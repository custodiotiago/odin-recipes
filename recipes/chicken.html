    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken à la King is one of my favorite classic comfort foods. This recipe is easy to adapt — you can make it thicker or thinner by changing the amount of roux and having a little extra stock on hand. Usually I make this with leftovers from a large roasted chicken. Serve over pasta, toast, rice, or mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ pound sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 large shallots, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup diced sweet bell peppers</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry sherry</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups chicken stock or broth</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>⅓ cup creme fraiche or heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 cups cubed roasted chicken</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh chives for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt. Saute until mushrooms release their moisture. Continue cooking until moisture evaporates and mushrooms begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add shallots; cook and stir just until shallots soften, 3 or 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Stir in flour to coat the mushrooms; cook until flour begins to turn golden, about 5 minutes, to form roux. Add peppers; cook and stir about 1 minute. Pour in sherry wine; allow to sizzle about 30 seconds. Stir in stock. Raise heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. When it starts to bubble, reduce heat to medium-low and cook until slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes stirring occasionally. Add nutmeg and cayenne pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir in thyme, parsley, cream, and chicken. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes. Check seasonings and adjust as needed. Top each serving with some chopped fresh chives.</li>
        </ol>
